LAB03 QUESTION:
The Tale of Numbers' Harmony

In the serene village of Arithmetica, numbers were not just symbols; they were living entities that coexisted in perfect harmony. Each number had a distinct personality, contributing to the village's balance and order. But occasionally, the numbers would come together for a special event called the Harmony Gathering. During the harmony gathering, the event starts with identifying their Five Point Summary or Descriptive Statistics. 

For the given set of numbers who arrived for the Harmony Gathering today, can you help the people in Arithmetica find their descriptive statistics?

[761, 123, 585, 275, 194, 840, 999, 622, 763, 40, 825, 687, 402, 338, 611, 987, 739, 95, 819, 568, 320, 126, 688, 948, 514, 223, 751, 379, 857, 767, 492, 162, 437, 934, 430, 343, 725, 511, 580, 678, 708, 823, 346, 179, 786, 663, 195, 890, 267, 502, 214, 300, 786, 961, 235, 559, 992, 919, 948, 318, 57, 787, 653, 317, 305, 172, 966, 182, 970, 17, 89, 624, 629, 595, 485, 752, 984, 978, 460, 124, 321, 256, 614, 852, 811, 561, 127, 207, 406, 615, 888, 391, 691, 470, 911, 401, 137, 600, 478, 682]

The values that Arithmetica is looking at are:

Mean

Minimum

Maximum

Range

The people of Arithmetica have another issue: they don't believe in the built-in functions (sum, len, max, min, sort, etc.) that Python provides. With the help of functions you design, try to convince the people from Arithmetica that both the outputs (the results generated by your custom functions and the functions that Python Provides) are the same.
